				<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
				<p>The ENACT Data Quality Explorer (DQE) allows you to compare your site's totalnum with the ENACT network statistics. 
				   You open your site totalnum file using this tool. The tool computes the ratio of counts of any ENACT ontology concepts 
				   divided by total number of patients at your site, expressed as a percentage. This percentage can then be compared with 
				   ENACT network statistics to detect missing counts and discover outliers. Any site can use this tool to perform data quality self-checks.
				   DQE is unique in that it uses network statistics as a barometer for data quality. The underlying assumption is that the overall 
				   percentage of patients with specific facts will generally be similar across hospital sites. Therefore fact types at sites that are 
				   much less/more frequent than the average could point to possible ETL problems.
				   DQE also empowers sites to perform self-service data quality checks without submitting site data anywhere. </p>
				<h3>Totalnum</h3>
				<p>The ENACT network provides an open-source script to compute the patient counts for all 
				   concept in all ENACT ontologies at a site (see documentation in <a href="https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=83001346">i2b2 community wiki</a>). 
				   A totalnum file is the result of running this high-performance counting script, which is available for SQLServer, Oracle, and Postgres databases. It 
				   is used as a starting point of assessing the quality of data at each site. Irregularities in the
				   counts may be indicative of mapping issues or ETL errors. Additionally, examining totalnum longitudinally can 
				   reveal differences between data loads.</p>
				<p>One important feature of the totalnum computed by the script is that the counts are obfuscated. 
				   A random number following a Gaussian distribution is added to the real count to create an obfuscated count. 
				   A real count that is fewer than 10 is marked as -1. This obfuscation allows sites to contribute their totalnum 
				   to the network and share them with other ENACT sites. For brevity, counts of patients always mean 
				   obfuscated count of patients in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>
				<p>We understand there exist sites would like to perform data quality checks before to eventually submitting their counts to the ENACT network. 
				   DQE fully supports this workflow by requiring only users to have a totalnum file. DQE is a javascript web application that runs on a 
				   browser and does not transmit any data anywhere. Sites can be assured that their data remains private.</p>
				   
				<h3>Computation of Network Statistics</h3>
				<p>Many ENACT sites contribute their totalnum to the ENACT network. The ENACT network computes the mean, 
				   standard deviation, min, max, median, and quartiles for the percentage of all concepts of ENACT ontologies across all 
				   contributing sites. These network statics are made available to DQE. Sites can compare their own data 
				   with the network statistics. Comparing site data with network statistics is a novel way to perform data quality checks.</p>
				<p>When loading your site's totalnum result into the tool, your site's counts are transformed into percentages. 
				   For the concept C, its percentage is defined as its count over the count of <span>\denominator\facts\</span>, a concept that 
				   represents all patients at that site.
				<div id="percentage_formula">
					Percentage<sub>c</sub> = 100 x 
					<math display = "inline-block">					  
					  <mfrac>
					   <msub><mi>Count</mi><mn>c</mn></msub>
					   <msub><mi>Count</mi><mn>\denominator\facts\</mn></msub>
					  </mfrac>					 
					</math>
				</div>
				 <p> The percentage of a concept can then be compared with ENACT network statistics. DQE considers site percentage an 
				   outlier if it is two standard diviations away from the network mean. Extreme values may be due to mapping errors for the counts 
				   -- or there are reasonable explanations for a particular site (e.g. site patient population are skewed due to speciality care at the site
				   or geographical location). In any case, outliers are highlighted in DQE so users can further investigate them.</p>
				
				<h2 id="fileformat">II. Totalnum File Format</h2>
				<p>When you select the <b>Choose a Totalnum File</b>, you can navigate and select a totalnum file of your choice on your computer. 
				   The tool uses client-side javascript to parse your file. No data is transmitted anywhere. Your file stays within the safe 
				   confines of your browser.<p>
				<p>Your selected totalnum file must conform to the following standards, or it will be rejected by the tool.<p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Three Columns:</b> Your file must contain three columns. The first column must be <b>c_fullname</b>. 
											  The second column must be <b>agg_count</b>, and the last column must be <b>agg_date</b>. 
											  Every row of the file therefore contains a concept's c_fullname, its aggregated count, 
											  and when the count was performed.</li>
					<li><b>Headers:</b> Your file must contain a header row of the three columns.
					<li><b>Delimted:</b> The columns must be separated by tabs (tab-separated-value format) or commas (comma-separated-value format). You columns must either be tab-delimited or comma-delimited, not a mix of both.</li>
					<li><b>File Extension:</b> DQE only looks for files with the following files extension <b>.tsv</b>, <b>.csv</b>, or <b>.txt</b>.</li>
					<li><b>\denominator\facts\:</b> One of the rows in your file must be the concept \denominaotor\facts\. This 
													 count represents the total number of patients in a site. The tool relies on it to 
													 correctly compute the percentage of a given condition. For example, if your 
													 \denomniator\facts\ has a count of 10000, and the count for 
													 \ACT\Demographics\Age\35-44 years old\37 years old\ is 900, then your site percentage for 
													 37-year old patients is 9%.<p></li>
				</ol>

				<p>This is a partial screen of a totalnums file. There is a header of three columns, each separated by a tab. Each row
				   is a concept, with its c_fullname, agg_count, and agg_date values.</p>
				<p>When the tool parses your totalnums file, every count of -1 is converted into 5 so the negative count will not 
				   turn computed percentages into a negative number. The same is done to counts in the network to compute safely for the
				   network statistics.</p>

				The legend shows how the sizes and colors encode the nodes in the visualization. The sizes indicate the site patient count. If
				a node has no count, it is shown as a small circle with no fill. Purple outlines indicate that a descendant 
				of this node is an outlier. Grey outlines mean no descendants of this node is an outlier. The fill colors indicate
				whether node is an outlier. Orange means this node's prevelance is more than 2 standard diviations higher than the network mean. 
				Light blue means this node's prevelance is more than 2 standard diviations lower than the network mean. Gray means this node
				is not considered an outlier.
